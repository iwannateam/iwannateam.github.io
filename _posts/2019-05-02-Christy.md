​I’m a bright but also sentimental person, love to talk with everyone. I love traveling and I’m such a foodie, I wanna explore all the good foods and beautiful places all around the world. I was born in the southern part of China but have a very northern-like personality. I’ve been studying in the U.S since high school and have been living on the east coast for almost 10 years. I’m good at communicating with others and take others’ perspectives.

## Credentials and Training

I was trained to be a multicultural counselor with cognitive-behavioral theory, evidence-based practice. I’ve worked as an intern school counselor and intern mental health counselor, provide individual counseling and facilitate group counseling for clients with mental health issues, especially depression and anxiety. I’ve passed the National Counselor Examination for Licensure and Certification.
