I was born in Guiyang, grew up in Shanghai, did my bachelor degree in Beijing, and pursued my master degree in Rochester, NY. I’m a flaneur who enjoys exploring and wandering in interesting places and is searching for my future hometown. I’m also a foodie and chocoholic who believes in “food therapy”. Besides, I’ve recently found out that I’m a cat person, but still a dog lover.

Currently, I’m working as a crisis counselor who handles all kinds of crisis calls, messages, and emails. Before this, I did my internship at Willow Domestic Violence Center as a counselor for survivors of domestic violence and completed a half-year practicum at a city district high school as a school counselor in Rochester.
